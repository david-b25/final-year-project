His journey took him into the oil and gas industry before returning to the UK, managing various projects and eventually coming back to Ireland in 2018. In Ireland, he worked for a civil and structural engineering design consultancy, managing projects with budgets over €10m.\n\nBack in Ireland, Ciaran undertook the renovation of houses in Clare as a designer and project manager, collaborating with architects and interior designers, a role he passionately enjoys. He became a BER Assessor in 2020, completing over 350 assessments nationwide.\n\nPassionate about Sustainability and Climate Action, Ciaran has completed courses in Thermal Insulation Installation, NZEB External Wall Insulation, and NZEB Ventilation, advocating for Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB).\n\nHolding a Diploma in Project Management, and qualifications in Occupational Health and Safety, First Aid, Architectural AutoCAD, and Mechanical Engineering AutoCAD, Ciaran prioritizes continuous professional development and lifelong learning in his business approach.","textColour":"#0c353d"}}},{"id":"4352","type":"ActionOne","extraAttributes":{"image":"https://julftz3s2fuspgpn.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/YojVxBVGD2zKBGnCMoxys-CvTXHjhDZnn9Hb1j8LGwYWqgOxuHis.png","backgroundColour":"#FFFFFF","title":{"text":"Have a question?
